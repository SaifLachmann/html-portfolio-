<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ever since I was a child, I have grown a striking passion for Technology; it fascinates me every time how our world has evolved from a simple microchip connection into a broad spectrum of different tech applications that ease our daily lives. My love for this field started when I was playing video games back in the day. I was very intrigued by how computers function and my curiosity has only led me to take it apart to learn this complex device's internal operation! I hope to specialize in computer engineering, specifically in the Artificial Intelligence sector, where I am most interested. I want to contribute to the continuous problem-solving process; I hope to attain considerable skills from this program to offer endless creative ideas and exciting enhancements to the current world systems!  
    My A-level subjects played a massive part in this domain, having taken Mathematics, a course I have grown to enjoy throughout my high school years. I learned essential topics like Calculus, Linear Algebra and Statistics, which heightened my knowledge and understanding of complex mathematical functions and procedures. I have also taken A-level courses in Physics and Computer Science; I have always enjoyed the classes since I am more of a practical person than a theory-based individual. Physics has helped me understand challenging concepts by utilizing my brain to find creative and meaningful solutions to questions. In contrast, Computer Science helped me build an excellent logic base, learning countless practical algorithms and methods.
    I have participated in many events and activities throughout my four years in high school. Amongst those events was the Model United Nations, I was one of the event organizers and received the role of "Head of IT" due to my vast wisdom in the field. I have helped by creating a website and hosting it on a domain service, and it was a great experience that enlightened me into my future career! Moreover, I have partaken in multiple school computer-based programs such as data science, robotics and python courses to aid my development journey. I am still continuously looking for more lessons/internships to apply for as well as skills to gain from various activities in different domains. My school has taught me to keep looking for challenging opportunities and seek more intelligence.  
    Usually, I enjoy educating myself about new programs. One company I am most interested in is Tesla Motors; I would love to have a tour of their workshop one day as it fascinates me how they revolutionize the car industry using Artificial Intelligence. One of the achievements I am most proud of is my ability to program a simple game from scratch on the website "Roblox", which receives over one thousand players daily! I have learned that the more you get into new occupations, the more you become successful, so I am always looking for new professions to read about and explore.  
    I use my spare time efficiently; I like spending my time studying courses that I sign up for. Consequently, I keep applying for competitions of different demands; my last competition was Genius Olympiad, as I won an honourable mention award for a scientific project I conducted. In addition to competitions, I sometimes visit my uncle's office, which specializes in computer engineering, to review the work being done on a continuous cycle, watching and listening to their instructions so that I can hopefully learn through their steps.
    To conclude, I have seen many advancements in the technology and I wish to be a major part in its gradual evolution, computers are slowly becoming a fundamental part of peopleâ€™s lives and I want to improve the daily experience people experience for the better!
